# Film in Colour

This project explores the impact of the leading cast's diversity on Hollywood movie box office performance, aiming to replicate the findings of Xing Fan's (2021) master's thesis and conducting additional analyses.

### Introduction
Research consistently shows that minorities, including racial and ethnic groups, women, and disabled groups, are underrepresented in the film industry (Iasiello, 2017; Eschholz, 2002; Karniouchina, 2023). This underrepresentation is evident in both leading roles and directorial positions, where employers often attribute the root of bias to consumer attitudes rather than organisational practices, explained by individual preference for racial and ethnic similarity within networks, as well as systemic issues such as lack of opportunities and outcomes for women and racial/ethnic minorities (Iasiello, 2017; Iasiello, 2020; Erigha, 2015). 

This underrepresentation carries substantial social and economic implications, potentially perpetuating discrimination and harmful stereotypes. It restricts the range of narratives available to society about diverse groups, thereby shaping perceptions over time.The empirical challenge of testing the influence and scope of consumer racial attitudes on purchasing decisions has constrained prior efforts to disentangle managerial bias from consumer bias. (Kuppaswamy, 2018.)

In this study, we expand upon research regarding consumer reactions to workforce diversity in the film industry, utilizing an intersectional data analysis approach. We replicate and build upon Xi Fang's 2021 study from The University of Guelph, which evaluated U.S. film performance in relation to race and gender diversity of casts (Fang, 2021). Our work further investigates the impact of diversity on viewing hours on Netflix. Moreover, we explore consumer discrimination nuances by examining the variability of responses to main cast diversity across different movie genres, using mixed effects modeling. This approach broadens our understanding of the social contexts in which consumer discrimination operates.

### Hypotheses
Specifically, this project investigates:
- _H2: The movie market performance is negatively related to the ratio of White actors in the movie leading cast._
- _H4: The movie market performance is negatively related to the ratio of female actors in the movie leading cast._
- _H5: The interaction of the ratio of actors from different ethnicities and the ratio of women has a significant impact on movie market performance._

### Suggestions for contributors and future analyses
The points below are suggestions for contributors to enhance this research:
- Analyze audience preferences by genre to identify key attendance drivers.
- Investigate how historical and cultural contexts within genres affect audience engagement.
- Assess the impact of genre-specific marketing on the success of movies with diverse casts.
- Study genre receptivity to diverse casts to find potential for broader storytelling.
- Improve the quality of the sample size from the top 10 highest budgeting movies per year to the highest 30 budgeting movies per year
- Incorporate further control variables such as release season (cite), movie duration, and IMDB movie score
- Investigate ethnicity as the independent variable as a more nuance substitute for race
- Investigate sexuality as an independent variable

### List of known issues
- The sample size used is one third of the sample used by Xing Fan, leading to the inability to replicate exact results
